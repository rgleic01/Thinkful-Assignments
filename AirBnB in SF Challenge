1. What’s the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?

Price: $10,000
It’s for an entire 4-floor, 7,500 SqFt Victorian house with a Hot Tub. Owned by Sarah in the Western Addition neighborhood

The 4 reviewers Dave, David, Kim, and Angie all left very positive reviews. 

Code:
-- get listing info
SELECT * FROM sfo_listings
ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 1

-- get reviews:
SELECT comments FROM sfo_reviews
WHERE listing_id = 24650875



2. What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?

The neighborhoods of Mission, Western Addition, South of Market, and Downtown/Civic Center are the most popular

code:
SELECT neighbourhood, COUNT(*) FROM sfo_listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood
ORDER BY count DESC



3. What time of year is the cheapest to go to San Fransisco? What about the busiest?
****The column names and values in 'cheapest' table were a bit cryptic.
I Assumed that the column "cheap_date" is a date when the listing is cheaper than usual****

July and August were the cheapest months. 

Summer/fall is the busiest. In order, the busiest months are September, October, June, July, and August. 

code:
--find chepeast months
SELECT date_part('month', cheap_date), COUNT(*) FROM cheapest
GROUP BY date_part
ORDER BY count DESC

--find busiest months (months were 'available' was most often 'true')
SELECT DISTINCT date_part('month', calender_date), COUNT(*) FROM sfo_calendar
WHERE available = 't'
GROUP BY date_part
ORDER BY count
